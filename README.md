                                      OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Finance Management (ILO8022) is an Institute Level Optional subject in the Final Year (Semester VIII) of the engineering curriculum. It provides a fundamental understanding of financial concepts, markets, instruments, and corporate financial strategies, essential for making informed economic decisions.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses key domains in Finance:

- **Financial Systems**: Overview of Indian financial systems, markets, and institutions.
- **Time Value of Money**: Concepts of compounding, discounting, and annuity.
- **Capital Budgeting**: Techniques for investment appraisal (NPV, IRR, Payback Period).
- **Working Capital Management**: Managing current assets and liabilities.
- **Sources of Finance**: Equity, debt, and hybrid instruments.
- **Financial Planning**: Ratio analysis and financial statement interpretation.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, lab experiments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference.**

As an engineering student, understanding financial management is crucial for making informed economic decisions, analyzing market trends, and developing a strong financial acumen. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for reviewing concepts, methodologies, and financial strategies.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Finance Management.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.
